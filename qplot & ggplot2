##Adding the color to the points for different sex on the graph clearly makes the plot easier to read, 
##same as altering the shape and size for the points, which also help people to quickly grasp the different distribution between female and male.
##The confidence bands on the trend lines also provide more information to the readers and make the trends of two populations stand out.
